# Notes

* I am inviting you today to an overview of data analysis methods that extend beyond classic statistics and highlight some of challenges and opportunities of "non-traditional" data.

* This module will be primarily about one specific method: topic modelling. But before we get to this I would like to provide some background to the general approach and give examples of related analysis methods in our domain, then cover topic modelling in general and close with a detailed example to prepare for the exercise part in the afternoon.

* Complex data analysis, what is meant by that? When we discussed the contents of this course and this module in particular, some of the following terms came up as potential topics, that we all thought to be important. Some, or most, are mentioned in the chapter of the SES methods book that was recommended reading for today. Namely data mining, pattern recognition etc. But the most appropriate heading for this would actually be the term "Data Science". A term that I assume pretty much everybody will have heard of.

* But what is it? And why is it relevant for us, both practically and theoretically?
